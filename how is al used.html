<h1>How is AI used ??</h1>
<p>Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories: 
    •	Narrow AI: Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates within a limited context and 
    is a simulation of human intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well and while these
     machines may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human
      intelligence. 
     
    •	Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligence
     we see in the movies, like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general 
     intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem. 
    </p>

<h1>WHAT CAN NARROW AI DO?</h1>
<p>
  There are a vast number of emerging applications for narrow AI: interpreting video feeds from drones carrying out visual 
  inspections of infrastructure such as oil pipelines, organizing personal and business calendars, responding to simple 
  customer-service queries, coordinating with other intelligent systems to carry out tasks like booking a hotel at a suitable 
  time and location, helping radiologists to spot potential tumors in X-rays, flagging inappropriate content online, detecting wear
   and tear in elevators from data gathered by IoT devices, generating a 3D model of the world from satellite imagery, the list goes
    on and on.
New applications of these learning systems are emerging all the time. Graphics card designer Nvidia recently revealed an AI-based 
system Maxine, which allows people to make good quality video calls, almost regardless of the speed of their internet connection.
 The system reduces the bandwidth needed for such calls by a factor of 10 by not transmitting the full video stream over the internet
  and instead animating a small number of static images of the caller, in a manner designed to reproduce the callers facial expressions
   and movements in real time and to be indistinguishable from the video.
However, as much untapped potential as these systems have, sometimes ambitions for the technology outstrips reality.
 A case in point are self-driving cars, which themselves are underpinned by AI-powered systems such as computer vision. Electric
  car company Tesla is lagging some way behind CEO Elon Musk's original timeline for the car's Autopilot system being upgraded to 
  "full self-driving" from the system's more limited assisted-driving capabilities, with the Full Self-Driving option only recently 
  rolled out to a select group of expert drivers as part of a beta testing program.
</p>
<h1>WHAT CAN GENERAL AI DO?</h1>
<p>General AI is very different, and is the type of adaptable intellect found in humans, a flexible form of intelligence capable of
   learning how to carry out vastly different tasks, anything from haircutting to building spreadsheets, or reasoning about a wide
    variety of topics based on its accumulated experience. This is the sort of AI more commonly seen in movies, the likes of HAL in
     2001 or Skynet in The Terminator, but which doesn't exist today – and AI experts are fiercely divided over how soon it will become
      a reality. </p>

<h1>
  HOW WILL AI CHANGE THE WORLD?
</h1>
<p>
  robots and driverless cars

The desire for robots to be able to act autonomously and understand and navigate the world around them means there is a natural
 overlap between robotics and AI. While AI is only one of the technologies used in robotics, use of AI is helping robots move 
 into new areas such as self-driving cars, delivery robots, as well as helping robots to learn new skills. At the start of 2020,
  General Motors and Honda revealed the Cruise Origin, an electric-powered driverless car and Waymo, the self-driving group inside
   Google parent Alphabet, recently opened its robotaxi service to the general public in Phoenix, Arizona, offering a service 
   covering a 50-square mile area in the city.
